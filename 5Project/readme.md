#Project: Create a world or a game world using what we know so far.

##World Story: Brief description of world. What is compelling, why do people want to be in it?

*World:
*Name:
*Scenes, Locations:
*Characters:
*Inventory:


When answering these questions think about what nouns, and verbs you've used.
//You can think of nouns as things. I'll refer to nouns or things throughout the assignment.
1. What types, and kinds of things are each nouns?
2. Do any of the nouns act as containers and hold other nouns?
3. What values do they have? Do they have default values you know, or are they discovered?

When creating variable we have to declare the variable to the program. Since the programming language
has a specific way of creating variables we need to create a variable name, and a type the language recognizes.
In C/C++ the simle types are for numbers, logic, and characters:
```
//Positive and negative integer, 16 bits with 0 in the middle.
int foo;
//unsigned integers are 16 bit positive starting at 0
unsigned int foo;
//real numbers
float bar;
double bar;
long double;
```

Create a list of the nouns, or things and then list underneath each the nouns, and verbs with each type next to them.
Ex:
World has:



Write a problem that creates the variables and assigns the default values to each one.


//One single character
char
//List of characters that make worlds
char[]
